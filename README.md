# Task Hounds - Work like a dog

Task Hounds is a local multi-agent development workspace. You give it a human directive, and it coordinates a Manager, Worker, Reviewer, and Chat agent around one project session.

The project is designed for people who want a visible, controllable agent loop instead of a black-box coding assistant. State is stored in SQLite, agent sessions are tracked per project, and the dashboard shows what the agents are doing in real time.

## Highlights

- Manager / Worker / Reviewer / Chat roles for autonomous development loops
- OpenCode-backed execution with reusable role sessions
- SQLite-backed project sessions, directives, todos, reports, and agent state
- React dashboard for live streams, settings, suggestions, todos, and chat
- Electron desktop build for Windows portable `.exe`
- Docker build for server-style deployment
- MIT licensed

## Quick Start

### 1. Install requirements

You need:

- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Node.js 20+
- npm
- OpenCode CLI installed globally through npm and available on `PATH`

Install or update OpenCode with npm:

```powershell
npm install -g opencode-ai
where opencode
```

On Windows, Task Hounds should resolve the npm global wrapper first, for example:

```text
C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\opencode.cmd
```

Do not point Task Hounds at `C:\Users\<you>\.opencode\bin\opencode.exe`; that standalone binary can use a different runtime/session store and cause `opencode run --attach --session ...` to hang or report missing sessions.

Install Python dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

Install and build the web UI:

```powershell
cd ui/web
npm ci
npm run build
cd ../..
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example file:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

The environment variable prefix is still `POWER_TEAMS_` for compatibility. You do not need to rename existing local settings.

Useful settings:

```env
POWER_TEAMS_DB=core/db/power_teams.db
POWER_TEAMS_REUSE_OPENCODE_SESSIONS=true
POWER_TEAMS_SILENCE_TIMEOUT=480
POWER_TEAMS_HARD_TIMEOUT=1200
```

### 3. Run the server

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "core"
python -m api.fastapi_server --port 8765
```

Open http://localhost:8765.

### 4. Start work

In the dashboard:

1. Pick or create a project workspace.
2. Write a Human Directive.
3. Press Start Loop or Run Once.

Task Hounds requires a pending Human Directive before it starts autonomous work. Suggestions and manager messages are context, not permission to run.

## Docker

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t task-hounds .
```

Run it:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" task-hounds
```

Then open http://localhost:8765.

The Docker image does not include local runtime data, SQLite databases, logs, OpenCode config, or desktop build artifacts.

## Windows EXE

The desktop app is built with Electron. The portable executable version is `1.0.0`.

Build it on Windows:

```powershell
.\build_exe.ps1
```

Output is written to:

```text
ui/desktop/dist/
```

The EXE package includes source resources needed by the app and the built web UI. It does not package local runtime folders, SQLite databases, logs, or personal OpenCode config.

## Architecture

Task Hounds uses SQLite as the runtime source of truth.

Important tables include:

- `project_sessions` for workspaces and per-role OpenCode session IDs
- `agent_registry` for agent state, model, role binding, and last errors
- `user_directives` for human-origin work directives
- `session_todos` for visible project work items
- `worker_reports` and `manager_messages` for agent reports and feedback
- `suggestion_queue` for manager-proposed next steps

Compatibility text files under `core/runtime` are treated as runtime mirrors and fallbacks. New control flow should prefer the DB.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for more detail.

## What Is Not Committed

These are intentionally excluded from the public repo:

- Runtime folders and logs
- SQLite database files
- OpenCode config/home folders
- Local `.env` files
- Electron and frontend build output
- Internal debug logs
- Local test-chat and OpenCode experiment folders
- `.hermes` workspace files

## Development Checks

Backend syntax check:

```powershell
python -m py_compile core/api/fastapi_server.py core/api/server.py core/power_teams/db.py core/power_teams/agents/base.py core/power_teams/agents/manager.py core/power_teams/agents/worker.py core/power_teams/agents/reviewer.py core/power_teams/mvp/runner.py
```

Frontend build:

```powershell
cd ui/web
npm run build
```
